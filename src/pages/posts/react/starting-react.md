  Hiking can sometimes involves bushwhacking and hiking is sometimes referred to
  as such. This specifically refers to difficult walking through dense forest,
  undergrowth, or bushes, where forward progress requires pushing vegetation
  aside.

# React 프로젝트 TypeScript로 시작하기

기존 Vanilla JS를 활용하여 웹 페이지의 이벤트를 제작하면서, 재사용성을 가지고 보다 재미있는 프론트엔드 환경을 원하게 되었다.
그 과정에서 TypeScript를 적용하여 객체지향의 특성을 지닌 웹 프로젝트를 만들게 되었다.

#### 간단하게 TypeScript를 적용하게 된 이유를 나열해보았다.
1. 정적 타입, '컴파일 언어'  
`<span style="color: yellow;">ㅁㄴㅇㄹ</span>`  
2. 자바스크립트 호환성
3. 객체지향 프로그래밍 지원
```js {numberLines:21}
return 'blah';
```

## Equipment

The equipment required for hiking depends on the length of the hike, but day hikers generally carry at least water, food, a map, and rain-proof gear. Hikers usually wear sturdy hiking boots for mountain walking and backpacking, as protection from the rough terrain, as well as providing increased stability. The Mountaineers club recommends a list of "Ten Essentials" equipment for hiking, including a compass, sunglasses, sunscreen, a flashlight, a first aid kit, a fire starter, and a knife. Other groups recommend items such as hat, gloves, insect repellent, and an emergency blanket. A GPS navigation device can also be helpful and route cards may be used as a guide.

> Returning home is the most difficult part of long-distance hiking; You have grown outside the puzzle and your piece no longer fits. ― Cindy Ross

Proponents of ultralight backpacking argue that long lists of required items for multi-day hikes increases pack weight, and hence fatigue and the chance of injury. Instead, they recommend reducing pack weight, in order to make hiking long distances easier. Even the use of hiking boots on long-distances hikes is controversial among ultralight hikers, because of their weight.

## Environmental Impact

Natural environments are often fragile, and may be accidentally damaged, especially when a large number of hikers are involved. For example, years of gathering wood can strip an alpine area of valuable nutrients. and some species, such as martens or bighorn sheep, are very sensitive to the presence of humans, especially around mating season. Generally, protected areas such as parks have regulations in place to protect the environment, so as to minimize such impact. Such regulations include banning wood fires, restricting camping to established camp sites, disposing or packing out faecal matter, and imposing a quota on the number of hikers. Many hikers espouse the philosophy of Leave No Trace, following strict practices on dealing with food waste, food packaging, and other impact on the environment.

Human waste is often a major source of environmental impact from hiking, and can contaminate the watershed and make other hikers ill. 'Catholes' dug 10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) deep, depending on local soil composition and covered after use, at least 60 m (200 feet) away from water sources and trails, are recommended to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination.
